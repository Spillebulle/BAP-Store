//! How this copy was installed, whether a newer release exists, and the one
//! true thing to say about getting it. Muster's `update::install` shape,
//! transcribed: [`install::detect`] is a pure function of a [`Probe`],
//! [`release::latest`] asks GitHub through a six-hour cache (or past it, for
//! a check the user asked for), and [`remedy::remedy`] chooses from the two
//! what to say and what to run.
//!
//! [`check`] does the three in order and returns a [`SelfUpdate`] the page
//! draws as it is; [`plan`] turns an actionable [`Remedy`] into the steps
//! the transaction runner executes, so a self-update is logged, batched and
//! cancellable like every other install.
//!
//! # Release asset names
//!
//! The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) must publish
//! these names, spelt exactly so, because this module names them to users
//! and `tests/selfupdate.rs` pins them:
//!
//! | Format | x86-64 | ARM64 |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Debian package | `brokey_<v>_amd64.deb` | `brokey_<v>_arm64.deb` |
//! | rpm package | `brokey-<v>-1.x86_64.rpm` | `brokey-<v>-1.aarch64.rpm` |
//! | pacman package | `brokey-bin-<v>-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` | not built |
//! | AppImage | `Brokey-<v>-x86_64.AppImage` | `Brokey-<v>-aarch64.AppImage` |
//! | Flatpak bundle | `brokey-<v>-x86_64.flatpak` (not built yet; the name is reserved so a bundle, when it ships, is found without a code change) | not built |
//!
//! `<v>` is the workspace version with no `v`; the tag is `v<v>`. No
//! tarball is published: a portable copy is told about the AppImage. A
//! format missing for an architecture yields a sentence with no file name.
